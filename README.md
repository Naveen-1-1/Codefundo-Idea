My team, which includes Naveen(me), Rutwik and Shreyas, will like to help to prepare for a disaster and manage a disaster better by creating a website. We have chosen to work on the natural disaster: floods. Our web application will consist of two parts.

a) First, we will provide solutions in order to prepare for a disaster and show what has happened in the past. For example, we will: 

1.	Find out the correlation between number of deaths and amount of rainfall during a flood by analysing these datasets;

2.	Find the average number of fatalities occurring in a given area of land;


3.	Show the place that are more prone to floods than the other places in a map and also show the number of floods that have occurred;

4.	Provide simple algorithmic solution by predicting the percentage of survival;


b) Second, we will manage the disaster better in the following ways:

1.	Our website will provide a map which has a facility to connect shelters and volunteer groups by showing location and housing density of each camp. This would ensure that resources are equally provided and shelter is adequately distributed. This also ensures that some camps aren’t overcrowded while others lie in vacancy. 
 
2.	The website would also encapsulate a dashboard which displays the nearest hospitals, army camps, NGO’s, cooperative stores etc. 


3.	The website will have an option for people to donate food items, clothes, blankets, etc. The volunteers will then get notified to get these items.

4.	The website will have direct ties with helplines across the region and provide connectivity facilities to reach out for help. 


5.	The website would have a separate faction which would provide any user to become a volunteer and help out in extreme cases which need rescue operations or food distribution drives. The application would have an algorithm to allocate the volunteer in groups and send them to stressful areas.
